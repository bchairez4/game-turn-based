# game-turn-based

Created by Brian Chairez

This project implements a turn-based combat game in C++.

The main objective of the game is to defeat the enemy opponent. 
Characters take turns deciding what action to take for themselves or against their opponent. 
Characters are implemented with individual stats. 
Stats can vary from attack-heavy to defense heavy with multiple variations to choose from. 

Items included are distributed to all characters. 
Items range from stat boosters to secondary attacks.
